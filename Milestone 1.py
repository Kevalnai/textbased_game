"""  In this game, the user is the player who will enter in responses to
prompts you give them.  The game will respond to the playerâ€™s inputs providing
feedback in the form of a story.  The adventure in this story is up to you to
create. Your program will ultimately include a continuous main loop constantly
receiving user input and providing output while using different functions based
on user input for processing.  """
